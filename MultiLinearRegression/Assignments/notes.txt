Linear Regression:

Linear regression in simple term is answering a question on “How can I use X to predict Y?”
where X is some information that you have, and Y is some information that you want.
Linear regression creates an equation in which you input your given numbers (X) and it outputs the target variable that you want to find out (Y).
Linear regression equation is,
Y=a+bx
In this equation:
* y is the output variable. It is also called  the target variable in machine learning or the dependent variable.

* x is the input variable. It is also referred to as the feature in machine learning or it is called  the independent variable.

* a is the constant

* b is the coefficient of independent variable

MultiLiear Regression:

Multiple Linear Regression assumes there is a linear relationship between two or more independent variables and one dependent variable. 
The Formula for multiple linear regression:
Y=B0+B0X1+B2X2+……+BnXn+e
* Y =   the predicted value of the dependent variable

* B0 = the y-intercept (value of y when all other parameters are set to 0)

* B1X1= the regression coefficient (B1)  of the first independent variable (X1) 

* BnXn = the regression coefficient of the last independent variable

* e = model error
